Dummy project that reproduces the call-exception bug of ethers.js

## Update

It eventually turned out that this is not a bug with ethers.js. For more details, [read my comment here](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/870#issuecomment-640107482) or [my post on StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/84036/abstract-contracts-cannot-be-initialised-can-they).
